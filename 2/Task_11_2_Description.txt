In Java, both exceptions and errors are subclasses of the Throwable class. However, there are some important differences between them:

Exception:

	An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program.
	Exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as programmer errors, runtime errors, and external factors (e.g., network errors, hardware failures).
	Exceptions can be caught and handled within the program, which allows the program to continue executing.	
	
	Some examples of exceptions: 
		ArithmeticException: Thrown when an arithmetic error occurs, such as division by zero.
		FileNotFoundException: Thrown when a file cannot be found.
		NullPointerException: Thrown when a null reference is accessed.

Error:

	An error is a severe situation generated when the user performs an unexpected operation.
	Errors are typically caused by unrecoverable problems, such as system resource exhaustion or hardware failures.
	Errors cannot be caught and handled within the program, and they typically cause the program to terminate.
	
	Here are some examples of errors:

		StackOverflowError: Thrown when the stack overflows.
		OutOfMemoryError: Thrown when the program runs out of memory.
		SystemError: Thrown when a severe system error occurs.
